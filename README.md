Task Brief:

Using object oriented programming, create a simple card game that will do the following:

- Generate a deck of cards (standard 52 playing cards)
- Draw a hand of 5 cards
- Check if the drawn hand contains a ‘straight’ or a ‘straight flush’.
- The hand of cards must be returned as an array: ```[‘2c’, ‘6d’, ‘as’, ‘jh’, ’10c’]```.
- Aces can be high and low (a, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10, j, q, k, a are both valid sequences).

We are looking for quality, simple, elegant, easy to read and maintainable code.
